  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <h2>My name is Jamie, and I'm learning to code</h2>
  <!-- What I did before Codeworks -->
  <h3>Prior to CodeWorks</h3>
  <p>I worked as an aircraft mechanic in Boise, and quickly realized that it was not the career for me, I started
    teaching myself
    some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm excited about a career as a developer because of the opportunity to work
    on projects that I care about and creating useful applications from scratch.
  </p>

  <!-- What I hope to get out of this course -->
  <h3>Hopes for the course</h3>
  <p>I hope to further the skills I've developed on my own, and set myself up for a career as a developer. I'd love to
    work
    at a startup company initially, but would also like to develop the skills to be able to freelance and develop my
    own business as a developer/engineer.
  </p>
